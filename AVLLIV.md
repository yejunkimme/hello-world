## AVLLIV Analysis


## part 1
This is an analysis based on single match performance.  
I haven't followed much of Aston Villa's game last season or this season.  
Might be bit wrong on individual playstyle.  

### Basic Villa set-up vs Liverpool. 
#### 4-4-2
![442](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51032518/95745977-036b6480-0cd1-11eb-88bd-c31e67fad30b.gif)

##### Ross-Ollie most front defensive wall.

Liverpool formed with their usual 4-3-3 with Diogo Jota replacing Sadio Mane who is quarantining himself due to Covid-19,  
and Keita for injured Liverpool's captain Jordan Henderson. 

Liverpool won the league last season with staggering performance from very high up pitch full-backs and fluent switching play from front three. 
Villa came up with 4-4-2 with Ross Barkley and Oliver Watkins forming front defensive line. while Jack Grealish and Mahmoud Trezeguet forming mid defensive line with John McGinn and Douglas Luiz.  
Douglas Luiz and John McGinn were given very strict role to protect back four.

you can clearly see the defensive lines even without any annotation.

#### Fantastic Four
Villa's most attacks consisted of just front four.  
While full-backs and two holding midfielder Luiz and McGinn staying behind to prevent Liverpool's counter attack.  
Liverpool's instant press to regain possession of the ball is notorious.  
Villa's front four are resilient of the press, especially Jack Grealish.  
However, Liverpool's organized press was not so much disciplined with their leader Jordan Henderson missing the game due to injury.  
Villa front four's ball carrying runs were a very good tactical decision in that it utilizes Jack Grealish's on-the-ball as well as the other three.  
It also prevents unstructured defensive line for Luiz and McGinn doesn't have to do progressive runs or high risk pass.  

these are tactical instruction for front four.  

##### Trezeguet : late-run option, direct, mixer play

> notice Luiz performing easiest pass in both situations. clear instruction enables players to stick to tactic. 

##### Watkins : manipulates Gomez and provides header option. primary air target. 
**6th goal** for Villa.

> Liverpool struggled to block Grealish-side attack. Their defence was not disciplined at all and Salah didn't help TAA much often.  
Joe Gomez had nightmare of a performance defending Ollie Watkins. 

-----
#### Villa's different approach to close down flanks. 
  Jack Grealish engaged in defending Villa's left flank rather care-freely (not entirly off duty).  
  Villa's captain were given lesser duty to mark Salah.  
  However, since Grealish's attacking threat made Liverpool's right full-back TAA intimidated.  
  Because Grealish poses very lethal threat, TAA and Salah couldn't engage in attack care-free.  
  Most of the goal and goal-scoring chances were from Grealish.

  On the other side, Trezequet were given much defensive role.  
  Trezeguet marked Jota or Robertson depending on the situation.  
  This defensive mind made Trezeguet's attacking engage rather restricted.  
  As stated above, Trezequet wasn't really involved in combination play and was ordered to play direct drrible and mixer play on the ball.  
  Off the ball, since Trezeguet starts run deep in the line, he only provided late-run option to hold Robertson wide from VVD.

## part 2
### Liverpool's answer to the wall.

To summarise so far, Villa's basic set-up were really good in that it made full advantage of their players and blocked Liverpool's primary attacking tactic, which is to achieve unstructured state in fast transition and causing overload with high up pitch full-backs. 

#### Unstructured Villa

Liverpool's main attacking route is through instant regain of ball possession.  
As well known, when fast transition occurs, defensive lines are wide and attacking side exploits the space wide open.  
This instant pressing, often called Gegen Pressing, requires athleticism and organization to the players.  
Liverpool lacked both factors due to the absence of Mane and Henderson.  

Liverpool won fast-transition fewer than their usual.

(Trezeguet apologizes, indicates clear instruction)

### To cause Villa's structured side out of position Liverpool took these approaches.

#### side change through long ball  

Liverpool's direct side change to cause trouble to structured Villa side.  
Usually Liverpool will regain possession of the ball with syncronised press.  
But Keita, and Wijnaldum lacked discipline, especially Keita.

## part 3

### Liverpool's second half struggle. 
#### Minamino in Keita out [45:00]
Klopp subbed in Minamino for Keita who had a really bad performance, lack of tracking run and no discipline in pressing.  
Minamino was assigned to right side of midfield to aid TAA which Keita should have done.
but failed to do his job and conceded 6th goal.  

![6353](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51032518/95761518-62d46f00-0ce7-11eb-9bd4-d3b868fca9e0.gif)

> no contribution in attacking neither.

![6944](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51032518/95768011-a1baf280-0cf0-11eb-91d1-a1c199a2f40a.gif)

#### Joe Gomez out Curtis Jones in [61:00]
This sub is based on Gomez's awful and awful performance. Not really a tactical substitution.  
Fabinho drops down to pair with VVD in certre half. 

#### Firmino out Milner in [68:00]
Finally, after conceding three, Klopp makes defensive change to his side. Milner covers Grealish now.
However, this is not enough to stop Villa captain. Salah should have helped too. 

![7425](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51032518/95768904-0460be00-0cf2-11eb-82a4-3d4014a2a1bd.gif)

> TAA is again left alone to stop Grealish. 

#### Villa's substitutions.
I'll skip this chapter for the article is too long already and they were not really important to the game.


### Conclusion: Dean Smith masterclass.

Liverpool couldn't play their style of football since Dean Smith tactically blocked down Liverpool's main attacking play.  
Dean Smith made it difficult for Liverpool to quickly change side with disciplined midfield four.  
And because he gave very simple and detailed order to attacking players, their attacking combination was lethal without sacrificing defensive trait.  

For Klopp, Keita lack of option in midfield made him diffucult.  
Keita did perform between the line few times, but couldn't thrive and didn't contribute anything defensively.  
Because Keita lacked defensive discipline, TAA and Gomez had to face Watkins and Grealish 2 on 2.  

Nonetheless, Dean Smith's tactical set-up really shone in this match and he does fully deserve the credit.  
Congratulation to him and Villa.
